# File Renaming Tool
This tool renames all files underneath the specified Root Folder as follow: If the filename contains the given Original String, that Original String will be replaced by the Replacement String. The content of the files will not change.

# Instructions:
1. Copy & Paste the Root Path (that's the path to the folder where all your files which you wish to rename sit.
2. Enter the Original String (Example: "REPLACE_ME").
3. Enter the Replacement String (Example: "Year 2022").
4. Press "Go".
Thereafter all files which contain the substring "REPLACE_ME" will be changed to "Year 2022".
Example:
   A File with the original name "Anual Report REPLACE_ME.pptx" will be renamed to "Anual Report Year 2022.pptx"

# Installation
No real installation is required. Just run the EXE file.

# Hint
Currently, the tool does NOT check the Replacement String for invalid Characters (such as '*', '?', ...). The user shall ensure that the Replacement String contains only valid characters which can be in a filename. I will fix this in the next version :-)


Enjoy it!
